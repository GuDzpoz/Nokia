# Nokia
A game originated from an old game on a Nokia phone. 
## Notice!
The code is poorly written and structured and thus is hardly readable. So I am putting it here just for storage and a personal reminder. For those who are reading this, you deserve a better game and had better **NOT** play the game or read the code. 
## Compiling
On Linux, after installing `sdl2`, `sdl2_mixer` and `sdl2_ttf`, just:
`make`
This should produce a executable file under release directory.
